# News Hive


This News App is powered by the GNews public API and provides users with the latest news articles from around the world. The app offers a user-friendly interface where news articles are organized by categories, allowing users to easily browse and read articles of their interest. 

## Features

- **Category-based News**: The app organizes news articles into distinct categories such as entertainment, business, sports, technology, health, science, and more. Users can select a category to view articles that pertain specifically to their interests.

- **Search Functionality**: A built-in search feature allows users to find news articles by entering relevant keywords. The app will then present a list of articles that match the search terms, making it easy to locate specific information.

- **Article Details**: Each news article includes a title, summary, publication date, source channel, and a link to the original article. This provides users with a clear overview of the content and the option to read further if desired.

- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive, providing a seamless experience across different screen sizes and devices. Whether users access the app from their desktop, tablet, or smartphone, the interface will adapt smoothly to fit their device.

## Technologies Used
